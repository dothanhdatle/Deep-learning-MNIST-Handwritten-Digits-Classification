# Deep-learning-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Classification
Experiments with Neural Network in Handwritten Digits Classification with MNIST data:
* Simple Neural network with 1 hidden layer
* Neural network with 2 hidden layers with 2 activation functions: ReLU, Tanh
* Neural network with batch normalization
* Neural network with He weights initialisation for ReLU activation
* Neural network with dropout to reduce overfitting.
